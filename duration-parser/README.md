# DurationParser


> This test is based on a real world example, relevant to what we do.
> A big part of Bramble is asking users to self-report on their workday (we are anti-surveillance). Part of this is asking how long they spent on meetings, or other > blockers. To make it as frictionless as possible for our users, we allow them to enter this duration in various ways e.g.

* 90m
* 90
* 1.5h
* 1h 30

> The possible combinations we accept are described in the test below. Your challenge is to make the tests pass! (The test file itself uses doctest). Solve it as you would any other problem - you can use 3rd party libraries if you like.
